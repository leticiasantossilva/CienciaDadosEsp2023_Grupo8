to fix #138 by using a different \"scaling base\" when the compositor supports the new [fractional-scale-v1](https://wayland.app/protocols/fractional-scale-v1) protocol.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, I observed no gaps or any overlap between the two outputs (each 3840x2160 pixels) at various tested scales. The issue with \"flipping\" scales (see discussion in #138) is also gone.\r\n\r\nTested on the following compositors:\r\n- Sway 1.8.1\r\n- Sway master (has fractional-scale-v1)\r\n- labwc 0.6.6\r\n\r\nI wanted to test on Hyprland 0.32.3 and Wayfire master as well (they would have fractional-scale-v1), but way-displays (even the released 0.9.0) fails to setup the layout when a fractional scale is used, so there is probably something else going

Pampati: \nQuestion 1: What is parallel computing? Parallel computing is when code gets split into operations to be worked on simultaneously.\n  Question 2: If there is a computer with 3 cores that can each take one task, and the tasks are 25ms, 632ms and 100ms in run time respectively, how long will the program take to run? It will take 632ms.\n  Question 3: Is sequential or parallel computing more efficient, and why? The efficiency of sequential or parallel computing depends on the nature of the task, with sequential computing offering simplicity and determinism but limited performance scaling, while parallel computing provides performance improvements for tasks that can be effectively parallelized but introduces complexity and overhead.\n  Question 4: What is the term called when a network has multiple paths leading up to one destination? (Used in fault-tolerant systems) path redundancy\n  Question 5: Using the image above, is this fault tolerant? The image above is fault tolerant because if any of the lines were cut off, it would still be executed because\n  of path redudancy so there are several lines connected to each computer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nighthawkcoders/teacher_portfolio/issues/comments/1848800444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":{"id":7919,"slug":"utterances","node_id":"MDM6QXBwNzkxOQ==","owner":{"login":"utterance","id":27908738,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI3OTA4NzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27908738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utterance","html_url":"https://github.com/utterance","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utterance/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utterance/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utterance/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utterance/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utterance/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utterance/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utterance/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utterance/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utterance/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"name":"utterances","description":"A lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues.
